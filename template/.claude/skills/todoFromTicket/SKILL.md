description: "Turn one ticket into draft prompt items in the user's todo file (TODO.<git user.name>.md, resolved as in the todo rules): fetch the ticket from the configured tracker (Jira via the Atlassian MCP server, GitHub Issues via gh, or the ticket text pasted after the key), download its attachments to <attachmentsDir>/<KEY>/, then append a `## KEY — summary` ticket block with 1–5 numbered dev items, each carrying the ticket key right after its id (`- [ ] #32 PROJ-123 prompt`), then 1–5 `QA:` items (`- [ ] #36 PROJ-123 QA: check …`) — the manual checks for the ticket, the user's own rows that Claude never works or ticks; their number does not follow the dev count. When the ticket ends in a context block (Server / App version / where-in-the-app lines) and an app-navigation skill is connected, that block becomes the ticket block's own first item. Starts no work. With --deep, the ticket is first handed to a read-only subagent that studies the codebase — where the ticket's surface lives, the likely cause or touch points, constraints the code imposes, the natural split of the work — and the prompts are drafted from that analysis; the file gets the same block, only sharper prompts, never the analysis itself. Also answers to the old name /todoFromJira. Use whenever the user wants a ticket turned into todo prompts — phrases like '/todoFromTicket PROJ-123', '/todoFromTicket <ticket-url>', '/todoFromTicket 42' (a GitHub issue), '/todoFromJira PROJ-123', 'make prompts from PROJ-123', 'add PROJ-123 to my todo', 'todo from ticket', 'draft prompts for this ticket'. This skill IS allowed to edit the user's todo file; that is its purpose."

# /todoFromTicket

The bridge from the project-management side to the todo file: one ticket becomes a ticket
block of draft first-prompts, numbered and keyed, ready for the user to edit and then work one
by one with `#N`. The output is prompts, nothing else — no work is started. The counterpart of
`/todoReverse`. `/todoFromJira` is the old name and still triggers it.

## Configuration

Read once per run from `.claude/prompt-todo/config.json`:

| key                    | use                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tracker.kind`         | `jira`, `github` or `none` — selects the backend below              |
| `tracker.jira.host`    | accepted in ticket URLs; `projectKeys` are the keys recognised bare  |
| `tracker.github.repo`  | `owner/repo` for `gh issue view`                                    |
| `attachmentsDir`       | where attachments go: `<attachmentsDir>/<KEY>/<filename>`           |
| `appNavigation.mode`   | `existing` → the context block becomes a `/<skill>` item (step 6)   |
| `appNavigation.skill`  | the skill's name                                                     |

## Argument forms

```
/todoFromTicket PROJ-123                                          # Jira key

```

## What Claude does

1. **Resolve the ticket key** — a Jira key `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-\d+`, a GitHub issue number, or
   the key/number taken from a URL (`/browse/KEY`, `/issues/N`). No key → say so and stop;
   this skill has no free-form mode without a key.

2. **Fetch the ticket** with the backend `tracker.kind` selects:
   - **`jira`** — `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` (`contentFormat: "markdown"`): summary,
     description, issue type, labels/components, status, and the attachment list. If the MCP
     server is not connected, say so and point to `/mcp` (login) or `/todoSetup tracker`.
   - **`github`** — `gh issue view <N> --repo <tracker.github.repo> --json number,title,body,labels,state,comments`.
     If `gh` is missing or not logged in (`gh auth status`), say so and point to
     `/todoSetup tracker`.
   - **`none`** — no fetch. If ticket text was pasted after the key, use it as the ticket
     (**paste mode**, also available with the other backends when the fetch fails). Otherwise
     stop with: "no ticket tracker is configured — run `/todoSetup tracker`, or paste the
     ticket text after the key."

3. **Download attachments** (unless `--no-attachments` or paste mode) to
   `<attachmentsDir>/<KEY>/<original-filename>` (suffix `(2)`, `(3)`, … on collision): Jira
   attachments via `mcp__atlassian__fetch` on each `content` URL; for GitHub, the image and
   file links in the issue body and comments via `curl -L`. Create the directory. Read image
   and log attachments if they change what the prompts should say.

4. **`--deep` only: study the codebase first.** Dispatch one read-only subagent with the
   Agent tool (the Explore type). Its brief carries the ticket key, summary, description,
   acceptance criteria and comments as fetched, the attachment paths with the facts read from
   images and logs that matter, and five questions to answer:
   1. where the ticket's surface lives — screens, modules, files, functions, with paths;
   2. for a bug, the likely cause and the code path; for a feature, the touch points;
   3. constraints the code imposes — the same value computed in two places, a module shared
      across platforms, tests that cover the area, patterns and utilities to reuse;
   4. the natural split into deliverables the code suggests (one, if it is one change);
   5. what the ticket leaves ambiguous, one line each.

   It returns a short report — a few lines per point, paths included — and edits nothing.

   **Draft from the report, not around it** (step 6). The prompts stay in the user's style
   and inside the ticket's scope, but they name the real surface and, where it helps, the
   module the user would name; the split follows the code's seams (a ticket that is one
   change still gets one item); a code-found constraint that changes how the work must be
   done may become a sub-bullet of the item it affects — one line, in the user's words; the
   `QA:` items name the exact screen or state the analysis showed. An ambiguity the report
   raised is not a prompt — say it in the reply instead.

   **Never into the file:** the report, its file lists, or the word "deep". The `> ` excerpt
   stays the ticket's own words; the block is exactly the one in step 7.

   **Fallbacks:** if no codebase is at hand (the project holds only the todo files) or the
   subagent fails, say so in one line and draft as without the flag. Paste mode works with
   `--deep` as with any backend. **Without `--deep`, nothing changes:** the prompts come from
   the ticket and attachments alone.

5. **Resolve the user's todo file** — `TODO.<name>.md`, `<name>` from `git config user.name`
   (the rule in `.claude/prompt-todo/RULES.md`). Run Autoincrement first, as on any touch. Edit
   tool only.

6. **Draft the prompts.** From the description and attachments, write 1–5 items, each the
   *first prompt* for one piece of work, in the user's style: imperative, short (one or two
   lines), naming the surface the way the user would ("the checkout button on iOS", not a
   class name), one deliverable per item. Add a tag from the rules' tag table only when the
   ticket says so (`IOS:`, `Android:`, `Web:` …; unspecified → no tag). A sub-bullet only
   for a constraint the ticket states explicitly. Do not invent scope the ticket does not
   contain; a ticket that is one task gets one item.

   **The context block.** Many bug templates end in a block of locator lines — `Server:` (or
   `Environment:`), `App version:`, and lines naming where in the app the bug lives (for the
   sample BestPizza app: `Restaurant:`, `Pizza:`, `Topping:`; for yours, whatever its screens
   are called). What happens to it depends on `appNavigation.mode`:
   - **`existing`** — the block gets one extra item **before** the dev items, taking the
     block's first id: the text `/<appNavigation.skill>`, and the locator lines as its
     sub-bullets, one per line, values as the ticket wrote them:

     ```markdown
     - [ ] #42 PROJ-321 /appNavigation
       - Server: stage
       - Restaurant: Downtown
       - Pizza: Margherita
       - Topping: Olives
     ```

     Typing its `#N` runs that skill with the sub-bullets as the spec, copied as written (see the
     **App-navigation items** paragraph of the rules). It carries no tag; the QA items say
     "on the #42 screen" instead of repeating the place. A ticket without such a block gets no
     such item — never invent a spec from prose.
   - **`none`** — no extra item: the locator lines stay as plain `  - ` sub-bullets of the
     first dev item, so nothing from the ticket is lost, and the QA items name the screen
     themselves.

   **Then the QA items** — after the dev items, 1–5 top-level items `- [ ] #N KEY QA: <check>`,
   each one verification the user performs by hand — which screen, what to do, what must be
   seen. Derived from the ticket's acceptance criteria or, failing those, from the dev items.
   Their number is independent of the dev count — **no one-to-one rule**: fewer, more, or the
   same, whatever the ticket needs (a one-line ticket may get one QA item; never more than
   five). They are `QA:` rows in the sense of the rules' tag table: Claude never works,
   rewrites or ticks them; the user ticks them once the check passes. Write them complete
   the first time. Skip them for a ticket whose status is already done, and say so.

7. **Write the ticket block** at the end of the todo file (Ids rule for the numbers):

   ```markdown
   ## PROJ-321 — Order total wrong after removing a topping
   > Add a Margherita, add olives, remove olives: the total still includes the topping. Attachments: todoAttachments/PROJ-321/order.log
   - [ ] #32 PROJ-321 /appNavigation
     - Server: stage
     - Restaurant: Downtown
     - Pizza: Margherita
     - Topping: Olives
   - [ ] #33 PROJ-321 Android+: Recompute the order total from the current toppings whenever one is removed.
   - [ ] #34 PROJ-321 Show the topping's price next to its remove button so a wrong total is visible at once.
   - [ ] #35 PROJ-321 QA: on the #32 screen, add olives, remove them: the total goes back to the pizza price
   - [ ] #36 PROJ-321 QA: on the #32 screen, add olives: the olives row shows its price, the total is pizza + that price
   ```

   The ids run in that order: the app-navigation item, the dev items, the QA items. The `#32`
   item exists only with `appNavigation.mode = existing` and a context block in the ticket;
   without one the block starts at the first dev item. For a GitHub issue the key is
   `#<number>`-free: write it as `GH-42` on the items and `## GH-42 — <title>` on the heading,
   so it never collides with the item ids.

   If a `## KEY` heading already exists, append only items that are not already there
   (compare intent, not wording) under that heading, and say which were skipped as duplicates.

8. **Reply**: the heading line, the app-navigation item first when there is one, each dev item
   with its id, then the QA items with theirs, the attachment paths, and one line saying
   nothing was started — the user works a dev item by typing its `#N`, closes it with a
   confirm word (`works` / `fixed`), and ticks the QA rows by hand once they pass. With
   `--deep`, two to four lines before the block say what the analysis found — the files the
   prompts point at, the cause in one clause, the ambiguities — so the user sees why the
   prompts read as they do.

## Notes

- The ticket key on every item is the durable link (grep `PROJ-321` finds a ticket's prompts in
  the todo file *and* the archive); the heading is only for reading. Both formats are defined
  in the todo rules, **Ticket blocks**.
- Never ticks, rewrites or archives anything; never touches other users' files.
- If the fetch fails, report the error and write nothing (or offer paste mode).
- `--deep` reads the codebase and never writes to it; the only file this skill touches is
  still the user's todo file.
